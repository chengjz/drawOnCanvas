# drawOnCanvas

## Create, test, and upload a JavaScript program that allows a person to draw on a Canvas object, using different colors and sizes, as well as the ability to clear a screen. This assignment is a simplified version of https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/game_intro.asp (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. but will still require some research.

## Steps:

1. Create a 800 x 500 drawing surface
2. Create a "pen" that draws a circle at the position of the mouse. As the mouse moves, so should the pen.   Additional controls are:
  "b" - change pen color to blue
  "g" - change pen color to green
  "r" - change pen color to red
  "y" - change pen color to yellow
  "up arrow" - make pen size larger
  "down arrow" - make pen size smaller
  "space bar" - clear the canvas (other than the current pen tip)
